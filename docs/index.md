# Privacy Policy for Recursify

**Last updated: February 09, 2026**

Recursify ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Recursify.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage

**Local Storage:**
Recursify is primarily a "local-first" application. The majority of the data you generate (including mood logs, sleep records, habit trackers, and personal notes) is stored locally on your device using a secure database. We do not currentlymaintain a central server that persistently stores your personal health or mood data.

**Data sent to AI Services:**
To provide AI-powered insights, the app transmits a subset of your recent data (mood history, sleep logs, and habits) to our secure cloud processor (Firebase Cloud Functions) which then forwards it to OpenAI's API.
- This data is **transient**: It is used solely to generate the analysis response and is not permanently stored by our cloud functions.
- By using the "AI Analysis" feature, you consent to this temporary data transmission.

*   **Google AdMob:** We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect data such as your Device ID, location, and usage data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads.
